# melody-magic

Implement a stylish landing page for a band's touring website, with the following features:
- Interactive header with band imagery
- Tour dates section
- Embedded YouTube video for a music video, using a placeholder video
- Social media integration
The band's name is not known, so use "My Band" as a placeholder. Use placeholders for the tour dates as well.
